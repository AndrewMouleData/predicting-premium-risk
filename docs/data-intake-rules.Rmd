## Data Intake Rules for This Project

### Data Source

This project pulls data from the UK Government’s STATS19 open relational dataset. All three core tables are ingested to ensure clean and complete relational joins:

1. Collisions  
2. Vehicles  
3. Casualties  

### Time Window & Year Selection

The STATS19 Collisions, Vehicles, and Casualties datasets are each distributed as longitudinal CSV files containing historical records dating back to 1979.

All three datasets are downloaded in full from the official GOV.UK source and stored verbatim in the local raw data directory (`data/raw`).

The analytical scope of this project is restricted to a 10-year window covering January 2015 to December 2024. This time window is enforced during SQL staging and downstream processing, not ingestion. Records outside this period are not included in analytical activities or results.

- **Data source:** [GOV.UK Road Safety Open Data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/road-safety-open-data)  

### Path & Format

- **Root path:** `data/raw/`  
- **Ingestion format:** Only `.csv` files are permitted.

*Note: The contents of `data/raw/` are gitignored.*

### File Storage Structure

The `data/raw/` directory contains one CSV file per STATS19 dataset (Collisions, Vehicles, Casualties), each representing the full longitudinal extract provided by the source.

No restructuring, splitting, filtering, or value-level modification is performed within the raw data layer.

### File Naming Conventions

Upon download, the raw data CSV files are assigned consistent, dataset-level filenames to reflect their "master" status and assist ingestion into SQL. This renaming applies only to file names and does not alter file contents in any way.

- Collisions: `data/raw/collisions_master.csv`  
- Vehicles: `data/raw/vehicles_master.csv`  
- Casualties: `data/raw/casualties_master.csv`  

### Rules

- **No edits within `data/raw`:** Aside from non-destructive file-level renaming as described above, all data inside `data/raw` must remain identical to the downloaded source files. This includes, but is not limited to, cleaning, column renaming, filtering, splitting, reformatting, or value transformation.
