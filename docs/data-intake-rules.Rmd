## Data Intake Rules for This Project

### Data Source

This project pulls data from the UK Government’s STATS19 open relational dataset. All three core tables are ingested to ensure clean and complete relational joins:

1. Collisions  
2. Vehicles  
3. Casualties  

### Time Window & Year Selection

To maintain relevance to modern road safety conditions and ensure statistical stability, this analysis uses a **10-year span** of fully validated, year-complete data covering January 2015 to December 2024.

- **Data source:** [GOV.UK Road Safety Open Data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/road-safety-open-data)  
- **Exclusions:** All records prior to 2015 and after 2024 are deliberately excluded at ingestion and are not present in the governed raw data layer.

### Path & Format

- **Root path:** `data/raw/`  
- **Ingestion format:** Only `.csv` files are permitted.

*Note: The contents of `data/raw/` are gitignored.*

### File Storage Structure

Files in `data/raw/` are organised into annual subdirectories, with three files per year corresponding to Collisions, Vehicles, and Casualties.

### File Naming Conventions

The directory structure inside `data/raw/` is standardised and organised by year to facilitate automated iteration and downstream processing.

- Collisions: `data/raw/{year}/collisions.{ext}`  
- Vehicles: `data/raw/{year}/vehicles.{ext}`  
- Casualties: `data/raw/{year}/casualties.{ext}`  

### Rules

- **No edits within `data/raw/`:** All data inside `data/raw/` must remain in the exact state in which it was downloaded. This includes, but is not limited to, cleaning, renaming, filtering, or reformatting.
